Hi! I'm Jie Wu, currently a first-year M.S. student in Artificial Intelligence at [SIGS](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Yujiu Yang](https://sites.google.com/view/iigroup-thu/about). 

Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Wuhan University in June 2024, where I was fortunate to work under the guidance of Prof. [Zheng Wang](https://wangzwhu.github.io/home/) and Assoc. Prof. [Zuchao Li](https://zcli-charlie.github.io/).

I am focusing on post-training for Code LLMs, under the advice of Researcher [Xin Zhang](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Xin_Zhang42).

Education
======

- **Aug. 2024 - Jun. 2027** M.Sc., SIGS, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China.

- **Sep. 2020 - Jun. 2024** B.Sc., School of Computer Science, Wuhan Univeristy, China.
<br>GPA: 3.98/4.0, Rank: 1/226


Publications
======

- [arXiv 2025] [Focal Preference Learning for Code Generation via Iterative Debugging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02783)
<br> **Jie Wu**\*, Haoling Li\*, Xin Zhang\*, Jianwen Luo, Yangyu Huang, Ruihang Chu †, Yujiu Yang, Scarlett Li

- [ICML 2025] [EpiCoder: Encompassing Diversity and Complexity in Code Generation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RAxe7nF4Oz&noteId=hZW2ZVgfaS) [[code](https://github.com/microsoft/EpiCoder)]
<br> Yaoxiang Wang\*, Haoling Li\*, Xin Zhang\*, **Jie Wu**, Xiao Liu, Wenxiang Hu, Zhongxin Guo, Yangyu Huang, Ying Xin, Yujiu Yang†, Jinsong Su†, Qi Chen, Scarlett Li
<br> We introduce a novel feature tree-based synthesis framework for generating diverse and complex code instruction data, and present the EpiCoder series that achieve SOTA in both function and file-level code generation tasks.

- [MM MIS'24 Oral] [Multi-modal Fake News Detection via Decision Uncertainty](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3689090.3689389) [[code](https://github.com/JieWu02/T-FND)]
<br> **Jie Wu**, Danni Xu\*, Wenxuan Liu, Joey Zhou, Yew Ong, Siyuan Hu, Hongyuan Zhu, Zheng Wang†
<br> We distinguish among uni-modal information sources through accurate estimation of their decision uncertainty, employing this uncertainty as a confidence measure and indicator of information imbalance to guide feature fusion.
