Hi. I'm Jie Wu, currently a second-year M.S. student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at [SIGS](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Yujiu Yang](https://sites.google.com/view/iigroup-thu/about). 

I am focusing on post-training for Code LLMs, under the advice of [Xin Zhang](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Xin_Zhang42).

Education
======

- **Aug. 2024 - Jun. 2027** M.Sc., SIGS, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China.

- **Sep. 2020 - Jun. 2024** B.Sc., School of Computer Science, Wuhan Univeristy, China.
<br>GPA: 3.98/4.0, Rank: 1/226


Publications
======
- [EMNLP 2025 Main] [Teaching Your Models to Understand Code via Focal Preference Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02783) [code]
<br> **Jie Wu**, Haoling Li\*, Xin Zhang\*, Xiao Liu, Yangyu Huang, Jianwen Luo, Yizhen Zhang, Zuchao Li, Ruihang Chu†, Yujiu Yang, Scarlett Li
<br> Target-DPO leverages the idea of iterative debugging to tackle the challenges in Code LLM preference learning, enabling more focused alignment on critical error tokens, and achieves significant performance gains on diverse coding tasks.

- [ICML 2025 Poster] [EpiCoder: Encompassing Diversity and Complexity in Code Generation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RAxe7nF4Oz&noteId=hZW2ZVgfaS) [[code](https://github.com/microsoft/EpiCoder)]
<br> Yaoxiang Wang, Haoling Li\*, Xin Zhang\*, **Jie Wu**, Xiao Liu, Wenxiang Hu, Zhongxin Guo, Yangyu Huang, Ying Xin, Yujiu Yang†, Jinsong Su†, Qi Chen, Scarlett Li
<br> We introduce a novel feature tree-based synthesis framework for generating diverse and complex code instruction data, and present the EpiCoder series that achieve SOTA in both function and file-level code generation tasks.
