Hi! I'm Jie Wu, currently a second-year M.S. student in Artificial Intelligence at [SIGS](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Yujiu Yang](https://sites.google.com/view/iigroup-thu/about). Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Wuhan University in June 2024, where I was fortunate to work under the guidance of Prof. [Zheng Wang](https://wangzwhu.github.io/home/) and Assoc. Prof. [Zuchao Li](https://zcli-charlie.github.io/).

Selected Publications
======
(\* indicates equal contribution)

- [ICML 2025] [*EpiCoder: Encompassing Diversity and Complexity in Code Generation*](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RAxe7nF4Oz&noteId=hZW2ZVgfaS) [[code](https://github.com/microsoft/EpiCoder)]
<br> Yaoxiang Wang, Haoling Li, Xin Zhang, **Jie Wu**, Xiao Liu, Wenxiang Hu, Zhongxin Guo, Yangyu Huang, Ying Xin, Yujiu Yang, Jinsong Su, Qi Chen, Scarlett Li
<br> We introduce a novel feature tree-based synthesis framework for generating diverse and complex code instruction data, and present the EpiCoder series that achieve SOTA in both function and file-level code generation tasks.

- [ACMMM 2024] [*Assess and Guide: Multi-modal Fake News Detection via Decision Uncertainty*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3689090.3689389)
<br> **Jie Wu**, Danni Xu, Wenxuan Liu, Joey Zhou, Yew Ong, Siyuan Hu, Hongyuan Zhu, Zheng Wang
<br> We distinguish among uni-modal information sources through accurate estimation of their decision uncertainty, employing this uncertainty as a confidence measure and indicator of information imbalance to guide feature fusion.
